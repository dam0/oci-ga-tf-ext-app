# OCI WAF Policy Fix and APEX Integration Summary

## Issue Resolution

### Problem
The OCI Web Application Firewall (WAF) policy was failing with a 400-InvalidParameter error due to unsupported syntax:
- `cidr_match()` function is not supported in OCI WAF
- Incorrect JMESPATH expression syntax
- Mixed IP filtering and path filtering in WAF conditions

### Solution
Implemented a **multi-layered security architecture** that separates concerns:

1. **Network Security Groups (NSGs)** - Handle IP filtering
2. **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** - Handle path filtering  
3. **Host Firewalls** - Handle port-level filtering

## Architecture Changes

### WAF Policy (Fixed)
```hcl
request_access_control {
  default_action_name = "BLOCK_DEFAULT"
  
  # Rule to allow access to marine data register path
  rules {
    name                = "allow-marine-data-register"
    type                = "ACCESS_CONTROL"
    action_name         = "ALLOW_MARINE_DATA"
    condition_language  = "JMESPATH"
    condition           = "i_starts_with(http.request.url.path, '/ords/r/marinedataregister')"
  }
  
  # Rule to allow health checks to root path
  rules {
    name                = "allow-health-checks"
    type                = "ACCESS_CONTROL"
    action_name         = "ALLOW_MARINE_DATA"
    condition_language  = "JMESPATH"
    condition           = "http.request.url.path == '/'"
  }
}
```

### Network Security Groups (IP Filtering)
NSGs handle IP filtering at the network level:
- **Load Balancer NSG**: Only allows HTTP/HTTPS from specified CIDR blocks
- **Bastion NSG**: Only allows SSH from specified CIDR blocks  
- **Private Compute NSG**: Only allows traffic from bastion and load balancer

### IP Filtering Configuration
```yaml
# Allowed CIDR blocks for application access
allowed_ipv4_cidr = ["10.0.0.0/8"]
allowed_ipv6_cidr = ["2400:a844:4088::/48"]

# Allowed CIDR blocks for SSH access
allowed_ssh_cidr = ["0.0.0.0/0"]  # Can be restricted as needed
```

## Security Layers

### Layer 1: Network Security Groups (NSGs)
- **Purpose**: IP-based access control
- **Scope**: Network level (before traffic reaches load balancer)
- **Controls**: 
  - HTTP/HTTPS access from allowed CIDR blocks only
  - SSH access from allowed CIDR blocks only
  - Inter-service communication between components

### Layer 2: Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- **Purpose**: Application-level path filtering
- **Scope**: Application level (after NSG allows traffic)
- **Controls**:
  - Only allows access to `/ords/r/marinedataregister` path
  - Allows health checks to `/` path
  - Blocks all other application paths
  - Protection against common web attacks

### Layer 3: Host Firewalls
- **Purpose**: Port-level access control
- **Scope**: Individual instance level
- **Controls**:
  - Bastion: SSH (22) only
  - Private instances: SSH (22), Tomcat (8080), ORDS (8888)

## APEX 24.1 Integration

### Features Added
- **Automatic APEX Installation**: Downloads and installs Oracle APEX 24.1 images
- **Tomcat Integration**: Serves APEX images through Tomcat at `/i/` context path
- **Performance Optimization**: Configured with caching and compression
- **Verification Tools**: Automated testing and verification scripts

### APEX URLs
- **Images Base URL**: `https://load-balancer-ip/i/`
- **Example**: `https://load-balancer-ip/i/apex_ui/img/apex_logo.png`

### APEX Directory Structure
```
/opt/apex/                    # APEX installation directory
/opt/tomcat/webapps/i/        # APEX images served by Tomcat
/opt/tomcat/conf/Catalina/localhost/i.xml  # Tomcat context config
```

## Testing and Validation

### Terraform Validation
```bash
cd /workspace/oci-terraform-ansible
terraform init
terraform validate  # ✅ Success! The configuration is valid.
```

### APEX Testing
```bash
cd ansible
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.ini test-apex.yml
```

### WAF Testing
The WAF policy now validates successfully and provides:
- Path-based filtering (only `/ords/r/marinedataregister` allowed)
- Health check support (`/` path allowed)
- Default block behavior for all other paths

## Benefits of This Architecture

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
- NSGs handle network-level security
- WAF handles application-level security
- Host firewalls handle instance-level security

### 2. **OCI Compliance**
- Uses supported OCI WAF syntax and functions
- Leverages OCI NSG capabilities for IP filtering
- Follows OCI security best practices

### 3. **Maintainability**
- Clear separation makes troubleshooting easier
- Each layer can be modified independently
- Configuration is more readable and understandable

### 4. **Security Effectiveness**
- Multi-layered defense in depth
- IP filtering at network level (most efficient)
- Path filtering at application level (most specific)
- Port filtering at host level (most granular)
