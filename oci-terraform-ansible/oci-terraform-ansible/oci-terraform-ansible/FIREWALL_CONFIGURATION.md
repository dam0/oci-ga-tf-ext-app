# Firewall Configuration Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive firewall configuration implemented for the OCI Terraform with Ansible provisioning setup. The firewall configuration provides host-level security using firewalld on all compute instances.

## Implementation Details

### Firewall Roles

1. **Common Role Enhancement** (`ansible/roles/common/`)
   - Added basic firewall configuration to the common role
   - Includes firewall installation, service management, and basic rules
   - Added handlers for firewall service management

2. **Dedicated Firewall Role** (`ansible/roles/firewall/`)
   - Specialized role for comprehensive firewall management
   - Group-specific configurations for different instance types
   - Automatic rule verification and status reporting

### Port Configuration

#### Bastion Hosts
- **SSH (port 22)**: Administrative access from allowed CIDR blocks
- **All other ports**: Blocked by default

#### Private Instances
- **SSH (port 22)**: Administrative access via bastion host
- **Tomcat (port 8080)**: Web application traffic from load balancer
- **ORDS (port 8888)**: Oracle REST Data Services
- **All other ports**: Blocked by default

### Configuration Files

#### Group Variables
- `ansible/group_vars/all.yml`: Global firewall settings
- `ansible/group_vars/bastion.yml`: Bastion-specific firewall rules
- `ansible/group_vars/private_instances.yml`: Private instance firewall rules

#### Role Structure
```
ansible/roles/firewall/
├── defaults/main.yml    # Default variables
├── tasks/main.yml       # Main firewall tasks
├── handlers/main.yml    # Service handlers
└── meta/main.yml        # Role dependencies
```

### Key Features

1. **Automatic Configuration**: Firewall rules are automatically applied during Ansible provisioning
2. **Persistent Rules**: All firewall rules persist across system reboots
3. **Group-Specific Rules**: Different firewall configurations for bastion and private instances
4. **Status Verification**: Automatic verification and reporting of firewall status
5. **Flexible Configuration**: Easy customization via Ansible group variables
6. **Test Playbook**: Dedicated test playbook for firewall validation

### Security Benefits

1. **Defense in Depth**: Adds host-level security on top of OCI Network Security Groups
2. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Only required ports are opened
3. **Automated Management**: Reduces human error in firewall configuration
4. **Consistent Configuration**: Ensures all instances have proper firewall rules
5. **Audit Trail**: Clear documentation of which ports are open and why

### Testing

A dedicated test playbook (`ansible/test-firewall.yml`) is provided to:
- Check firewall service status
- List active firewall rules
- Test port connectivity (if netcat is available)
- Provide detailed reporting of firewall configuration

### Usage

The firewall configuration is automatically applied when running the main provisioning playbook:

```bash
cd ansible
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.ini provision.yml
```

To test firewall configuration separately:

```bash
cd ansible
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.ini test-firewall.yml
```

### Customization

Firewall settings can be customized by modifying the appropriate group variable files:

- Global settings: `ansible/group_vars/all.yml`
- Bastion settings: `ansible/group_vars/bastion.yml`
- Private instance settings: `ansible/group_vars/private_instances.yml`

## Integration with Existing Security

This firewall configuration complements the existing security features:

1. **OCI Network Security Groups**: Provides network-level security
2. **Web Application Firewall**: Provides application-level security
3. **Host Firewall**: Provides host-level security (this implementation)
4. **SSL/TLS**: Provides encryption in transit
5. **Private Subnets**: Provides network isolation

Together, these create a comprehensive security posture with multiple layers of protection.
