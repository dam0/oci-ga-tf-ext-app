# Minimal OCI WAF Configuration

## Current Status

The OCI Web Application Firewall (WAF) policy has been simplified to a minimal working configuration to resolve JMESPATH syntax errors and response access control issues.

## Current WAF Configuration

### Actions
```hcl
actions {
  name = "ALLOW_MARINE_DATA"
  type = "ALLOW"
}

actions {
  name = "BLOCK_DEFAULT"
  type = "RETURN_HTTP_RESPONSE"
  code = var.waf_block_response_code
  headers {
    name  = "Content-Type"
    value = "text/plain"
  }
  body {
    type = "STATIC_TEXT"
    text = var.waf_block_response_message
  }
}
```

### Request Access Control
```hcl
request_access_control {
  default_action_name = "BLOCK_DEFAULT"
  
  # Rule to allow access to marine data register path
  rules {
    name                = "allow-marine-data-register"
    type                = "ACCESS_CONTROL"
    action_name         = "ALLOW_MARINE_DATA"
    condition_language  = "JMESPATH"
    condition           = "i_starts_with(http.request.url.path, '/ords/r/marinedataregister')"
  }
  
  # Rule to allow health checks to root path
  rules {
    name                = "allow-health-checks"
    type                = "ACCESS_CONTROL"
    action_name         = "ALLOW_MARINE_DATA"
    condition_language  = "JMESPATH"
    condition           = "http.request.url.path == '/'"
  }
}
```

## What Was Removed

### 1. Request Rate Limiting
- Removed to eliminate potential sources of JMESPATH syntax errors
- Can be re-added later once basic WAF is working

### 2. Request Protection Rules
- Removed complex OWASP protection rules
- These were causing JMESPATH compilation errors

### 3. Response Access Control
- Completely removed to avoid "responseAccessControlRule[0]" errors
- OCI WAF was trying to create default response rules with invalid syntax

## Security Coverage

### Current Protection
1. **Path-based Access Control**: Only allows access to specific paths
   - `/ords/r/marinedataregister` - Marine data register application
   - `/` - Health checks and root path
   - All other paths are blocked by default

2. **Default Block Behavior**: Any request not matching allowed paths is blocked

### Network-Level Protection (Still Active)
1. **Network Security Groups (NSGs)**: IP-based filtering
   - Only allows traffic from specified CIDR blocks
   - Primary layer of IP-based access control

2. **Host Firewalls**: Port-level filtering on individual instances

## Benefits of Minimal Configuration

### 1. **Reliability**
- Uses only verified JMESPATH syntax
- Eliminates complex expressions that cause compilation errors
- Focuses on essential functionality

### 2. **Maintainability**
- Simple configuration is easier to troubleshoot
- Clear separation of concerns with NSGs handling IP filtering
- Reduced complexity means fewer potential failure points

### 3. **Security Effectiveness**
- Still provides core path-based access control
- Works in conjunction with NSGs for comprehensive protection
- Default-deny approach ensures security by default

## Testing the Configuration

### Terraform Validation
```bash
cd /workspace/oci-terraform-ansible
terraform validate  # Should return: Success! The configuration is valid.
```

### Expected Behavior
1. **Allowed Requests**:
   - `GET https://load-balancer/ords/r/marinedataregister/...` ✅ ALLOWED
   - `GET https://load-balancer/` ✅ ALLOWED (health checks)

2. **Blocked Requests**:
   - `GET https://load-balancer/admin` ❌ BLOCKED
   - `GET https://load-balancer/ords/r/other-app` ❌ BLOCKED
   - `POST https://load-balancer/upload` ❌ BLOCKED

## Future Enhancements

Once the basic WAF is working, we can gradually add back:

### 1. Request Rate Limiting
```hcl
request_rate_limiting {
  rules {
    name                = "rate-limit-marine-data"
    type                = "REQUEST_RATE_LIMITING"
    action_name         = "BLOCK_DEFAULT"
    condition_language  = "JMESPATH"
    condition           = "i_starts_with(http.request.url.path, '/ords/r/marinedataregister')"
    configurations {
      period_in_seconds         = 60
      requests_limit           = 100
      action_duration_in_seconds = 300
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Request Protection (OWASP Rules)
- SQL Injection protection
- XSS protection
- Other OWASP Top 10 protections

### 3. Response Protection
- Response header security
- Content filtering
- Data loss prevention

## Variables Used

```hcl
# WAF configuration variables
variable "enable_waf" {
  description = "Enable Web Application Firewall"
  type        = bool
  default     = true
}

variable "waf_block_response_code" {
  description = "HTTP response code for blocked requests"
  type        = number
  default     = 403
}

variable "waf_block_response_message" {
  description = "Response message for blocked requests"
  type        = string
  default     = "Access Denied: This request has been blocked by the Web Application Firewall."
}
```

## Deployment Status

- ✅ **Configuration Valid**: Terraform validates successfully
- ✅ **Syntax Correct**: Uses only supported OCI WAF JMESPATH functions
- ✅ **Core Security**: Path-based access control implemented
- ✅ **Multi-layered**: Works with NSGs for comprehensive security
- ✅ **Repository**: Changes committed and pushed

The minimal WAF configuration is now ready for deployment and should resolve the previous JMESPATH syntax errors while maintaining essential security functionality.
